# **Digital-Wallet**

This Digital Wallet application allows users to register with an initial configurable balance (e.g., ₹20 or ₹50). Once onboarded, users can transfer money to others, view their current balance, and see a history of recent transactions. Email notifications are sent upon user creation and successful transactions.
